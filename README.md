# OpenCore - Dell Latitude E6430s, Big Sur (tested)

> **Note:** The **internal SATA controller** of the Dell Latitude E6430s is compatible with macOS. Ensure your BIOS has its SATA settings turned to AHCI and not RAID, it is also advised to disable VT-dx and remove the Dock (USB docks are fine). Installation was tested with macOS Big Sur. If issues arise, consider testing with an external drive temporarily.

This repository provides a fully functional OpenCore EFI configuration for running macOS on the **Dell Latitude E6430s**. This setup allows macOS Big Sur to be installed and run with support for essential features like Wi-Fi, audio, power management, and the touchpad. Check Releases for the EFI.

## Features

- **macOS Compatibility**: Tested with **macOS Big Sur** (will not work on Monterey+, use a different SMBIOS and AirportItwlm kext for Catalina and Older).
- **Wi-Fi**: Intel Wi-Fi support via **AirportItlwm** kext.
- **Audio**: Audio working with **AppleALC** (IDT 92HD93 codec, layout-id required).
- **Power Management & Sleep**: Managed by **SSDTs** tailored for the E6430s.
- **Touchpad**: Fully functional with **VoodooPS2Controller.kext**.
- **iGPU**: Custom configuration for Intel HD Graphics 4000.

## Hardware Specifications

- **CPU**: Intel Core i7-3540M (Ivy Bridge).
- **GPU**: Intel HD Graphics 4000.
- **RAM**: Up to 16GB (2 SODIMM slots).
- **Wi-Fi**: Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 (replace with macOS-compatible card for native Wi-Fi).
- **Audio**: IDT 92HD93 codec.
- **Touchpad**: ALPS Touchpad.
- **SSD**: SATA interface (HDD or SSD recommended).
- **USB Ports**: USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 ports.
- **Display**: 14-inch HD or HD+ non-touch screen.

## Installation

For installation instructions, please refer to the official [OpenCore Installation Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) for detailed steps on setting up macOS with OpenCore.

> **Note:** The macOS installation was tested with **macOS Big Sur**. Other macOS versions (such as Monterey or Ventura) may work, but compatibility is not guaranteed.

## Kexts Used

- **AirportItlwm.kext**: Wi-Fi support for Intel cards.
- **AppleALC.kext**: Audio support for IDT codec (layout-id required).
- **VoodooPS2Controller.kext**: Touchpad and keyboard support.
- **VirtualSMC.kext**: SMC emulation for macOS.
- **Lilu.kext**: Core patching library for kext compatibility.
- **BlueToolFixup.kext**: Bluetooth compatibility.
- **NVMeFix.kext**: Enhances SSD compatibility (optional).

## Known Issues

- **Wi-Fi**: Native Wi-Fi requires a macOS-compatible card (e.g., Broadcom or Fenvi).
- **Shutdown/Restart**: The system may not properly shut down or restart in some configurations.
- **Discrete GPU Models**: If your E6430s has an NVIDIA GPU, disable it using the appropriate SSDT.
- **Trackpad Gestures**: Limited multi-touch gesture support with ALPS touchpad.

> **Note:** This project has been a success! I will be using macOS on this laptop until browser support for Big Sur ends, when that happens, I'll be trying out OpenCore Legacy Patcher for this Laptop, macOS runs fast and is more snappy than Windows 11 here.

## Post-Install Issues

- **High CPU Usage**: Users have reported higher-than-usual CPU usage. For more details on post-install fixes and optimizations, refer to the [OpenCore Post-Install guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/).
- **Power Management**: For Ivy Bridge processors, refer to [Sandy and Ivy Bridge Power Management](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/pm.html#sandy-and-ivy-bridge-power-management).

## Important Instructions

### SMBIOS Generation

For a successful installation, use the recommended SMBIOS **MacBookPro11,1** (Intel Core i5-4258U @ 2.40 GHz). While this SMBIOS corresponds to a 4th Gen processor, it is compatible with Ivy Bridge CPUs and Intel HD 4000 GPUs. This ensures proper system identification in macOS.

To generate your SMBIOS:

1. Download **GenSMBIOS** from [here](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS).
2. Follow the instructions in the README of the repository to generate a unique **SystemUUID** and other required identifiers.
3. Replace the SMBIOS settings in your **config.plist** with the ones generated by **GenSMBIOS**.

### Replace Wi-Fi Card (Optional)

For native Wi-Fi support, it is highly recommended to replace the stock Intel Wi-Fi card with a Broadcom card that is natively supported in macOS. Guides are available online for compatible card models and replacement steps.
